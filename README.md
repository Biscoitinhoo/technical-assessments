### Coding for nothing isn't for me.
One of the things that I don't like ([shout out for Chief Keef that probably doesn't like it too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g5ZF6DUrHI)) is coding for nothing.
Because of that, I created this repository to upload some technical assessments that I've done and will do.

### How can this be useful for me?
It probably isn't. Just take a look at the challenge description and how I managed to solve it if you're curious enough. Maybe you can learn something new!
